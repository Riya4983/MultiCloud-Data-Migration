# MultiCloud-Data-Migration

<h2>Description</h2>
This project implements a MultiCloud Architecture using Terraform to deploy resources across Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It involves the following key steps:
1. Setting up IAM users, access keys, and preparing the environment for Terraform deployment in both AWS and GCP.
2. Deploying an application named Luxxy for COVID-19 testing, including database setup, Docker image creation, and Kubernetes deployment.
3.  Migrating database and PDF files between GCP Cloud SQL and AWS S3, ensuring seamless integration and data consistency.

For instance, a hotel can utilize this MultiCloud platform to maintain the COVID-19 test results of its guests securely. The application ensures efficient management of guest information, facilitating easy access to test results and ensuring compliance with health regulations.

By following the step-by-step instructions provided in the README file, users can successfully deploy, manage, and migrate resources in a MultiCloud environment, achieving a robust and scalable infrastructure for their applications.
